Small 2D game "Happy new year". 

This study project is a very small 2D game.

This project improved my skills in the following areas: window management, event handling, colors, textures. And also improved my basic skills: level up in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so forth.

We needed to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX.
This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
